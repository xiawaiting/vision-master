 This is a refined version of the Computer Vision stack originally developed by the Team AGV-IIT-KGP, and now managed and maintained by xiawaiting. We are continually learning and striving to implement the algorithms of the book **Feature Extraction and Image Processing**. All our work takes place through GitHub [Pull requests](https://github.com/xiawaiting/vision-master). You can find the list of resources at [Awesome Computer Vision](https://github.com/xiawaiting/awesome-computer-vision).
