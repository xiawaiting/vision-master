[![Build_status](https://travis-ci.org/xiawaiting/vision-master.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xiawaiting/vision-master) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/xiawaiting/vision-master/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/xiawaiting/vision-master) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/xiawaiting/vision-master/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/xiawaiting/vision-master)  

 This is a refined version of the Computer Vision stack originally developed by the Team AGV-IIT-KGP, and now managed and maintained by xiawaiting. We are continually learning and striving to implement the algorithms of the book **Feature Extraction and Image Processing**. All our work takes place through GitHub [Pull requests](https://github.com/xiawaiting/vision-master). You can find the list of resources at [Awesome Computer Vision](https://github.com/xiawaiting/awesome-computer-vision).

For further guidance, please go through the IPython Notebook `Tutorial 1.ipynb` or get in touch with us via email.

Using the Tutorial
------------------

The tutorial is an IPython Notebook, which is an interactive computational environment that combines formatted text instructions and executable code cells.  

* **Install IPython**: You can easily install it through the anaconda package available at the [Continuum Analytics web site](http://continuum.io/downloads).

* Clone the repo:

```git clone https://github.com/xiawaiting/vision-master.git```  

* Open the Tutorial:

```ipython notebook Tutorial\ 1.ipynb &```  

* You can also view the Tutorial online at [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/xiawaiting/vision-master/blob/master/Tutorial%201.ipynb), although the code cells on nbviewer are not executable.
